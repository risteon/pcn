# Setup Point Completion Network

* clone from github, use my fork.
* create conda env with python3.7 `conda create ...` , `conda install python=3.7`, `conda install numpy scipy matplotlib`
* install latest tf1 tensorflow `pip install tensorflow==1.15`
* install open3d `conda install -c open3d-admin open3d`
* apparently, install cython `conda install cython`
* need also other dependencies: scikit-learn `conda install scikit-learn`, `conda install addict`, `conda install pandas`, `conda install plyfile`
* `pip install pyyaml`
* apparently, install arrow with conda: `conda install pyarrow` and delete pyarrow from requirements.txt. Pinning the pyarrow version to 0.10 did not work due to conflicts.

* install pcn requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

* run updated makefile in pc_distance folder

* download stuff from google drive and put it into the data folder (see Readme in data folder)
